Tynn-Shan
===================

**Description**

    Tynn-Shan is an exiled Rayyan Nomad. She has 3 fingers on each hand, and 3 toes on her digitigrade feet. Her skin is a pale pink colour, and her eyes are large milky blue orbs. She is completely without hair, though she has some soft cartilage on her scalp forming large semi-rigid ears, and fine cilia on her flesh that feel like soft hair, but are actually part of her sense organs.
    Her attire consists of a hooded robe made of a foreign material, which clings tightly to her body. Her voice has a soft echo to it, as if passing through some sort of filter.
